# cipher-wizard

A web-based tool for encrypting and decrypting messages using the VigenÃ¨re cipher, with a feature for breaking the cipher using statistical analysis. The website should have a clean, modern UI, allowing users to easily input text to be encrypted or decrypted, select or input a key, and then display the results. For the cipher-breaking feature, the tool will analyze the encrypted text to suggest possible keys and the decrypted text based on letter frequency analysis. The design should be simple and intuitive, possibly with a dark theme and monospace font to give it a 'cipher' feel.
